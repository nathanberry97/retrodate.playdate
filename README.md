## Pre-commit and GitHub Actions

To use the pre-commit hooks, install the pre-commit package:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
brew install luarocks
```

Then, install the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit hooks are being used for formatting the code and I'm using
GitHub Actions for linting and testing.
